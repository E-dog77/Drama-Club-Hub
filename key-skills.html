<h1>Key Skills in Drama</h1>

<div class="container">
  <div class="skill"><h2>Presence</h2><p>The ability to command attention on stage through energy, focus, and awareness. A strong stage presence draws the audience in, even when a character is silent.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Voice Control</h2><p>Using your voice intentionally—adjusting pitch, volume, tone, and breath—to suit a character, emotion, or dramatic moment.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Body Language</h2><p>Communicating emotion, status, and intention through physicality. This includes posture, gestures, and movement.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Emotional Range</h2><p>The ability to authentically express a wide variety of emotions, from subtle to extreme, while staying connected to character.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Timing and Rhythm</h2><p>Mastering the pace of your delivery and movement, especially for comedic or dramatic effect. Good timing keeps scenes alive and engaging.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Listening and Reacting</h2><p>Being truly present in a scene by paying attention to scene partners and responding honestly, not just waiting to speak.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Memorisation and Recall</h2><p>Learning lines, blocking, or choreography and retrieving them accurately and consistently during performance.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Musicality</h2><p>Understanding rhythm, pitch, and tempo in performance. This applies to songs, stylised movement, or vocal variety in monologues.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Coordination</h2><p>The ability to move your body with precision and control, especially in stage combat, choreography, or partner scenes.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Stamina</h2><p>Sustaining energy and focus during long rehearsals or performances. Physical and mental endurance is vital for consistent work.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Spatial Awareness</h2><p>Knowing where you and others are on stage. Helps with safe movement, strong blocking, and effective stage pictures.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Discipline</h2><p>Staying focused, reliable, and committed throughout rehearsals and performance. Includes punctuality, preparation, and respect.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Adaptability</h2><p>Responding to unexpected changes or mistakes without breaking character. Flexibility in both scripted and improvised work.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Collaboration</h2><p>Working effectively with others to create theatre. This includes sharing ideas, supporting others, and being open to feedback.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Resilience</h2><p>Handling feedback, mistakes, nerves, or failure with maturity. The ability to bounce back and try again.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Characterisation</h2><p>Building and performing a believable character using voice, body, emotion, and imagination.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Imagination</h2><p>Using creative thinking to invent characters, worlds, or solutions during improvisation and rehearsal.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Expressiveness</h2><p>Making strong, clear choices with your face, voice, and body to show emotion and character.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Dramaturgy</h2><p>Understanding the story, context, themes, and structure of a script or scene. Helps inform performance choices.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Projection</h2><p>Using breath and vocal technique to make your voice carry clearly across a space without shouting.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Articulation</h2><p>Speaking clearly so every word is understood. Involves precise mouth and tongue movements and vocal control.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Confidence</h2><p>Believing in your ability to perform. Confidence helps you take risks, make bold choices, and perform without fear.</p></div>
  <div class="skill"><h2>Substitution (Uta Hagen)</h2><p>A technique where you connect a character’s emotional experience to your own life, e.g., imagining who you would grieve if your character is mourning.</p></div>
