The game leader says the name of someone in the circle. The person whose name was called out has to quickly duck down while the two people next to them try to “shoot” each other by pointing finger guns at each other and saying bang! Whoever says bang last out of the two is out. If you duck or shoot when you don’t need to, you’re out. If your name is called and you don’t duck, then you’re out. There’s always some practice rounds before you actually start eliminating people. When there are two people left they stand back-to-back and given a buzz word. Every time the leader says a word the last two take a step; when the buzz word is said they must turn and shoot each other. Whoever shoots first wins.</div>
