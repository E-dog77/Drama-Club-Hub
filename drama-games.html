    <p><strong>Works On:</strong> Voice Control, Articulation, Emotional Range, Listening & Reacting, Expressiveness</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In pairs, students pass a neutral line like “It’s time to go” back and forth, changing the emotion or vocal trait (e.g. whisper, joy, fear, sarcasm). Helps improve clarity and vocal flexibility. Reflect afterwards on breath, clarity, and tone.</p>

    <p><strong>People Needed:</strong> 4+</p>
    <p><strong>Works On:</strong> Musicality, Timing and Rhythm, Coordination, Voice Control, Listening & Reacting, Expressiveness</p>

  <div class="game">
    <h3>Stage Picture Sculpting</h3>
    <p><strong>People Needed:</strong> 3+</p>
    <p><strong>Works On:</strong> Spatial Awareness, Collaboration, Body Language, Characterisation, Imagination, Presence</p>
