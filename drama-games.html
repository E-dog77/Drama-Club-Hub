  <div class="works-on"><span class="label">Works On:</span> Emotional Range, Expressiveness, Voice Control, Collaboration, Imagination, Listening & Reacting</div>
  <div class="description"><span class="label">Description:</span> Each student is assigned a specific emotion (e.g., awe, fear, pride, nervousness). When cued by a “conductor,” students express their emotion vocally and physically. The conductor layers them in one by one, building to a full “emotional orchestra.” A second round can reverse roles or introduce switching emotions mid-performance. Excellent for expanding students’ expressive capabilities.</div>

  <div class="description"><span class="label">Description:</span> Players stand in a circle and pass a beat using the words “Zip,” “Zap,” and “Zop” in sequence. The rhythm must stay steady, and mistakes (hesitations, incorrect words, out-of-sequence responses) reset the game. Variations include changing tempo, playing in silence, or adding character voices/emotions to each word. A foundational rhythm game used to sharpen reaction and ensemble timing.</div>

  <div class="description"><span class="label">Description:</span> In a circle, players pass a rhythmic sound (clap, stomp, vocal beat, etc.) around. Adding to the sound, e.g. stomp, add another stomp so it is stomp, stomp, then a clap so it is stomp, stomp, clap, and so on.</div>
